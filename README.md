The problems solved under these patterns use a varied set of algorithmic techniques.
We will make use of Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search to solve problems related to Trees and Graphs. 
Similarly, we will also cover Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Recursion, Greedy algorithms, and Divide &amp; Conquer.
